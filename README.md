# Dev Environment Setup

1. Make sure `iojs` is installed. to manage multiple versions of node, we will use `nvm`.
 - Run `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.25.1/install.sh | bash`.
 - Make sure the nvm is sourced properly in your shell config file. If `nvm` runs properly, everything is set up properly.
 - Run `nvm install iojs`.
2. Clone the repo to your machine. Run `npm install` from within the repo.
3. Run `npm run start`.
